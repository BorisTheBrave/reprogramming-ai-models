# README

This is code created for the [Apart Research's "Reprogramming AI Models" Hackathon](https://www.apartresearch.com/event/reprogramming-ai-models-hackathon). See the project writeup for more details.

The `main` branch has stripped notebooks. Checkout the `dirty` branch for notebooks (mostly analysis and graphs) which have pre-generated charts and data interleaved.

## Running

Set up a poetry env with `poetry install`. Then create a file `API_KEY.txt` with your Goodfire API key. The notebooks can be each be run independently.
